## Integrating Renewable Energy Projects and Public Transportation Data

### Overview
This use case involves the integration of renewable energy projects data and public transportation ridership statistics in Abu Dhabi. The goal is to provide a comprehensive dataset that will help stakeholders understand the impact of renewable energy projects on public transportation systems, thereby facilitating more sustainable urban planning and development.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above
- Pandas library
- CSV files containing the renewable energy projects data and public transportation ridership data

### Implementation Steps
1. **Load the Datasets**: Use Pandas to load the CSV files containing renewable energy projects and public transportation ridership statistics.

2. **Merge the Datasets**: Merge the datasets on a common field, such as 'Location', to combine the data into a single DataFrame.

3. **Analyze the Data**: Perform analysis to determine the impact of renewable energy projects on public transportation. For instance, calculate the correlation between renewable energy capacity and public transit ridership.

4. **Save the Merged Dataset**: Save the merged dataset for further analysis and reporting.

### Example Code
python
import pandas as pd

# Load renewable energy projects dataset
renewable_energy_df = pd.read_csv('current-renewable-energy-projects-abu-dhabi.csv')

# Load public transportation ridership dataset
public_transport_df = pd.read_csv('public-transportation-ridership-statistics-abu-dhabi.csv')

# Merge the datasets on a common field, e.g., 'Location'
merged_df = pd.merge(renewable_energy_df, public_transport_df, on='Location', how='inner')

# Perform analysis to determine the impact of renewable energy projects on public transportation
# Example: Calculate the correlation between renewable energy capacity and public transit ridership
correlation = merged_df[['Estimated Capacity (MW)', 'Monthly Ridership']].corr()
print('Correlation between Renewable Energy Capacity and Public Transit Ridership:')
print(correlation)

# Save the merged dataset for further analysis
merged_df.to_csv('merged_renewable_transport_data.csv', index=False)


### Conclusion
This integrated dataset provides valuable insights into the relationship between renewable energy projects and public transportation in Abu Dhabi. By understanding these dynamics, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance sustainability and optimize urban mobility infrastructure.
